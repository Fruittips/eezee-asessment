# Eezee Frontend Internship Assessment

Author: Mah Yi Da

## Technologies Used

Frontend framework: Next.js \
Styling: styled-jsx and css classes

## How to Run App

1. git clone https://github.com/Fruittips/eezee-asessment.git

2. cd into `eezee-assessment` folder

3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

4. Run `npm run dev` on root folder to start development server

5. Open http://localhost:3000/ to view application

## Features

1. Persistence of cart quantity across all pages within the application

2. Products could be sorted from price "High to Low" and price "Low to High"

3. Brands are listed alphabetically in the `/brands` page

4. All brands and products are listed on their respective pages

5. Featured brands are listed on Home page.

6. Usage of links and buttons to redirect to different pages of the application

## Design Considerations

1. Usage of css files together with styled-jsx to allow for modular styling and reusability within the application.

2. Usage of custom hooks such as `useApiService.js` to allow for data fetching without repeating lines of code across all pages.

3. Separating components into different categories within the application allows for better maintainability and reading experience for developers.

4. Certain parts of the application maintains its state independently, allowing for better isolation of code and component reusability

5. Usage of query params and query slugs, to allow for other users to resume back to page with the same url the user left off at.

## File Structure

`/components`:

- All reusable components within the application are stored and categorised here.

`/context`:

- Stores all useContext related functions such as `cartQuantityContext.js`, which allows the quantity of items in the cart to be shared across components in the application.

`/hooks`:

- Custom hooks to fetch data via api calls are stored here.

`/pages`:

- Stores all pages to be used in the application.

`/services`:

- Contains relevant services to be used within the application.

`/utils`:

- Contains miscellaneous functions needed in the application. In this case, to convert string HTML into HTML.

## Challenges

1. Initial set-up of the entire project structure took a considerate amount of time. Much consideration was made in making sure project structure was modular enough to be scaled.

2. Coming up with common css classes to be used throughout the application as I was not as familiar with how to best use css files and styled-jsx.

## Things to improve on

1. Usage of resusable css classes for styling within the application could be improved further. There could be more categories included. For example, a separate css file for padding, space-related styling.

2. To provide more user feedback. Such as notification to indicate user has successfully added item to cart. Providing an error message upon invalid input in the quantity number field for products.
